Event-driven programming
------------------------------------------

gem5 is an event-driven simulator.
In this chapter, we will explore how to create and schedule events.
We will be building from the simple ``HelloObject`` from :ref:`hello-simobject-chapter`.

    Explain what event-driven programming is


Creating a simple event callback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In gem5's event-driven model, each event has a callback function in which the event is *processed*.
Generally, this is a class that inherits from :cpp:class:`Event`.
However, gem5 provides a wrapper function for creating simple events.

In the header file for our ``HelloObject``, we simply need to declare a new function that we want to execute every time the event fires (``processEvent()``).
This function must take no parameters and return nothing.

Next, we add an ``EventWrapper`` instance.
``EventWrapper`` is a template which takes two parameters, a SimObject class and a member function bound to an instance of that class.

We also add a ``startup()`` function that will be explained below.

.. code-block:: c++

    class HelloObject : public SimObject
    {
      private:
        void processEvent();

        EventWrapper<HelloObject, &HelloObject::processEvent> event;

      public:
        HelloObject(HelloObjectParams *p);

        void startup();
    };

Next, we must construct this event in the constructor of ``HelloObject``.
The ``EventWrapper`` takes a single parameter, which a reference to an instance of the SimObject defined in the ``EventWrapper`` declaration.

.. code-block:: c++

    HelloObject::HelloObject(HelloObjectParams *params) :
        SimObject(params), event(*this)
    {
        DPRINTF(Hello, "Created the hello object\n");
    }

We also must define the implementation of the process function.
In this case, we'll simply print something if we are debugging.

.. code-block:: c++

    void
    HelloObject::processEvent()
    {
        DPRINTF(Hello, "Hello world! Processing the event!\n");
    }


Scheduling events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, for the event to be processed, we first have to *schedule* the event.
For this we use the :cpp:func:`schedule` function.
This function schedules some instance of an ``Event`` for some time in the future (event-driven simulation does not allow events to execute in the past).

.. cpp:function:: schedule(Event *event, Tick when)

    Schedules the event (**event**) to execute at time **when**.
    This function places the event into the event queue and will execute the event at tick **when**.

We will initially schedule the event in the ``startup()`` function we added to the ``HelloObject`` class.
The ``startup()`` function is where SimObjects are allowed to schedule internal events.
It does not get executed until the simulation begins for the first time (i.e. the ``simulate()`` function is called from a Python config file).

.. code-block:: c++

    void
    HelloObject::startup()
    {
        schedule(event, 100);
    }

Here, we simply schedule the event to execute at tick 100.
Normally, you would use some offset from ``curTick()``, but since we know the startup() function is called when the time is currently 0, we can use an explicit tick value.

The output when you run gem5 with the "Hello" debug flag is now

More event scheduling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can also schedule new events within an event process action.
For instance, we are going to add a latency parameter to the ``HelloObject`` and a parameter for how many times to fire the event.
In the `next chapter`_ we will make these parameters accessible from the Python config files.

.. _next chapter: parameters-chapter

To the HelloObject class declaration, add a member variable for the latency and number of times to fire.

.. code-block:: c++

    class HelloObject : public SimObject
    {
      private:
        void processEvent();

        EventWrapper<HelloObject, &HelloObject::processEvent> event;

        Tick latency;

        int timesLeft;

      public:
        HelloObject(HelloObjectParams *p);

        void startup();
    };

Then, in the constructor add default values for the ``latency`` and ``timesLeft``.

.. code-block:: c++

    HelloObject::HelloObject(HelloObjectParams *params) :
        SimObject(params), event(*this), latency(100), timesLeft(10)
    {
        DPRINTF(Hello, "Created the hello object\n");
    }

Finally, update ``startup()`` and ``processEvent()``.

.. code-block:: c++

    void
    HelloObject::startup()
    {
        schedule(event, latency);
    }

    void
    HelloObject::processEvent()
    {
        timesLeft--;
        DPRINTF(Hello, "Hello world! Processing the event! %d left\n", timesLeft);

        if (timesLeft <= 0) {
            DPRINTF(Hello, "Done firing!\n");
        } else {
            schedule(event, curTick() + latency);
        }
    }

Now, when we run gem5, the event should fire 10 times, and the simulation will end after 1000 ticks.
The output should now look like the following.
