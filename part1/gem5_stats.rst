------------------------------------------
Understanding gem5 statistics and output
------------------------------------------

In addition to any information which your simulation script prints out,
after running gem5, there are three files generated in a directory called ``m5out``:

**config.ini**
    Contains a list of every SimObject created for the simulation and the values for its parameters.
**config.json**
    The same as config.ini, but in json format.
**stats.txt**
    A text representation of all of the gem5 statistics registered for the simulation.

Where these files are created can be controlled by

.. option:: --outdir=DIR, -d DIR

    The directory to be created which hold the gem5 output files, including ``config.ini``, ``config.json``, ``stats.txt``, and possibly other.
    The files in this directory are overwritten if they already exist.

config.ini
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file is the definitive version of what was simulated.
All of the parameters for each SimObject that is simulated, whether they were set in the configuration scripts or the defaults were used, are shown in this file.

Below is pulled from the config.ini generated when the ``simple.py`` configuration file from :ref:`simple-config-chapter` is run.

::

    time_sync_period=100000000000
    time_sync_spin_threshold=100000000

    mem_ranges=0:536870911
    memories=system.mem_ctrl

    [system.clk_domain]
    type=SrcClockDomain
    children=voltage_domain
    clock=1000
    domain_id=-1
    eventq_index=0
    init_perf_level=0
    voltage_domain=system.clk_domain.voltage_domain

    ...

    [system.membus]
    type=CoherentXBar
    clk_domain=system.clk_domain
    eventq_index=0
    header_cycles=1
    snoop_filter=Null
    system=system
    use_default_range=false
    width=8
    master=system.cpu.interrupts[0].pio system.cpu.interrupts[0].int_slave system.mem_ctrl.port
    slave=system.cpu.icache_port system.cpu.dcache_port system.cpu.interrupts[0].int_master system.system_port

Here we see that at the beginning of the description of each SimObject is first it's name as created in the configuration file surrounded by square brackets (e.g., ``[system.membus]``).

Next, every parameter of the SimObject is shown with it's value, including parameters not explicitly set in the configuration file.
For instance, the configuration file sets the clock domain to be 1 GHz (1000 ticks in this case).
However, it did not set the cache line size (which is 64 in the ``system``) object.

The ``config.ini`` file is a valuable tool for ensuring that you are simulating what you think you're simulating.
There are many possible ways to set default values, and to override default values, in gem5.
It is a "best-practice" to always check the ``config.ini`` as a sanity check that values set in the configuration file are propagated to the actual SimObject instantiation.


stats.txt
~~~~~~~~~~

gem5 has a flexible statistics generating system.
gem5 statistics is covered in some detail on the `gem5 wiki site <http://www.gem5.org/Statistics>`_.
Each instantiation of a SimObject has it's own statistics.
At the end of simulation, or when special statistic-dumping commands are issued, the current state of the statistics for all SimObjects is dumped to a file.

First, the statistics file contains general statistics about the execution:

    host_mem_usage                                 778640                       # Number of bytes of host memory used
    host_seconds                                     0.04                       # Real time elapsed on the host
    sim_insts                                        5712                       # Number of instructions simulated
    sim_ops                                         10314                       # Number of ops (including micro ops) simulated

The statistic dump begins with ``---------- Begin Simulation Statistics ----------``.
There may be multiple of these in a single file if there are multiple statistic dumps during the gem5 execution.
This is common for long running applications, or when restoring from checkpoints.

Each statistic has a name (first column), a value (second column), and a description (last column preceded by `#`).

Most of the statistics are self explanatory from their descriptions.
A couple of important statistics are ``sim_seconds`` which is the total simulated time for the simulation, ``sim_insts`` which is the number of instructions committed by the CPU, and ``host_inst_rate`` which tells you the performance of gem5.

Next, the SimObjects' statistics are printed.
For instance, the memory controller statistics.
This has information like the bytes read by each component and the average bandwidth used by those components.

Later in the file is the CPU statistics, which contains information on the number of syscalls, the number of branches, total committed instructions, etc.
