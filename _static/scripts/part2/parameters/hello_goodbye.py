"""
This is probably the simplest gem5 config file you can possibly create.
It creates a Root object and one *very* simple SimObject and simulates the
system. Since there are no events, this "simulation" should finish immediately

IMPORTANT: If you modify this file, it's likely that the Learning gem5 book
           also needs to be updated. For now, email Jason <power.jg@gmail.com>

# Create an instantiation of the simobject you created
